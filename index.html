        I got started to learn English with <strong>Pineee</strong>. She is so kind to me, so I think I am a lucky man. She is good at not only Korean but also English and Japanese. She has talent teaching skills and it fits to me. <br>

        <h3><u>The way I learn English was</u> <br></h3>
        She guesses and finds words that I don't know, she gets ready to teach me those words how or when to use. And then I listen to her about those. We watch it not only with subtitles but also without it several times.
        She literally dedicated me!<br>
