        Well, I hope you're here to apologize.<br><br>
        
        No. No. Put me down.<br>
        Give me him.<br><br>
        
        Easy Boy.<br>
        That's it.<br>
        Now sit. sit. <br>
        Now drop the boot.<br><br>
        
        You're such a good boy. Yes, you are.<br><br>
        
        You're tired from chasing the bad man all over the place.<br>
            all?<br>
        Excuse me?<br><br>
        
        Nobody appreciates you do they? DO THEY?<br><br>
        
        Come on. He's a bad horse!<br><br>
        
        Oh, he's nothing but a big sweet heart.<br>
        Is it not right? Maximus?<br>
        (Isn't that right?)<br><br>
        
        You've got to be kidding me.<br><br>
        
        Look. Today is kind of the biggest day of my life.<br>
        And the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.<br>
        Just 24 hours, and then you can chase each other to your heart's content.<br>
        And It's also my birthday. Just so you know.<br>
